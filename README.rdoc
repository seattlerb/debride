== DESCRIPTION:

Analyze code for potentially uncalled / dead methods.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Static analysis of code. Can be easily hooked up to a CI.
* As with all static analysis tools of dynamic languages, can't be 100%.
* Whitelisting known good methods by name or regexp.

== SYNOPSIS:

  % debride lib

  These methods MIGHT not be called:

  MyClass
    good_method                         lib/some/file.rb:16
    bad_method                          lib/some/file.rb:20
  ...

But you know that good_method is called (perhaps because it is public
API), then you can whitelist it:

  % echo good_method > whitelist.txt
  % debride --whitelist whitelist.txt lib

  These methods MIGHT not be called:

  MyClass
    bad_method                          lib/some/file.rb:20
  ...

You can also use regexps in your whitelist by delimiting them with //'s.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby 1.8+

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install debride

== CONTRIBUTING:

* sudo gem install minitest
* ruby -Ilib:test test/test_debride.rb
